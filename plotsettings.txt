# Solution: None is apparently a hashable type!

Add a new special level plev=None and a special variable q=None to plot_settings_dict
-> Multiple assignment becomes assignment to keyN=None
-> Access for (plev,q) must look for (None,q) and (plev,None); but which takes precedence?
-> Multiple reset must be possible, resetting both single keys and None
