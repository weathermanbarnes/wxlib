Introduction
============

Aims with dynlib
----------------

 * Avoid reinventing wheels
 * Fast diagnostics, suitable for running through larger data sets (e.g. 35 years of ERA-Interim at 0.5Â°-resolution)
 * Collect state-of-the feature detection algorithms
 * Foster standardisation: Paths, filenames, variable names, etc. for reusability
 * Be easy to use and well-documented
 * Provide a solution for most typical problem classes in gridded meteorological data analysis

What dynlib is
--------------

 * A large set of meaninful defaults for using standard data sets and plotting
 * A place to collect general-purpose scripts that are/will be useful to a larger group

What dynlib is not
------------------

 * A dump for personal special-purpose scripts
 * An interactive visualisation tool/data browser
 * Yet another scripting language
