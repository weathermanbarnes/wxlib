Contexts
--------

 * Technically: Set of configuration to be imported
   -> How to treat variable names for different contexts? Unify? 
      Probably not, because to complex/confusing. But then plot configuration must depend 
      on the context, leading to some repetition. Nevertheless, some wiring might be usefuly, e.g. for dyncal?
   -> Module containing settings objects must be disentangled from the actual configuration modules
   -> Static file name must be configurable (if applicable).
   -> Standard grid sizes must be configurable (if applicable).
   -> How to define some configuration for _all_ contexts? Or at least several at once? 
      Can one use decorator syntax for that?
   -> Several contexts can be imported. Later imports potentially overwrite settings from previous imports.
   -> Assuming mutually exclusive settings, the order of import must not matter.
      Hence there cannot be any interdependencies between contexts.
 
 * Conceptually: Provide all neccessary meta-data and configuration to work on a given data set
   -> New contexts can be derived from existing ones.
   -> Should more than one context may be able to be active? E.g. "plot_color", "erainterim" and "plot_area"?
      Probably yes. Avoids some repetition. All combinations among these contexts are meaningful.
   -> Should vertical levels be contexts?
      Maybe? Probably not? Would avoid some repetition, but would make some contexts to be very "small-scale". 
      Furthermore, there'd be no clear distinction to answer the question "Why are vertical level contexts but 
      not variables?"
