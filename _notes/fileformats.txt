Thoughts about agg, eof and comp file formats in netCDF

Option 1 for agg:
 * Same structure as instantaneous data: 1 plev and q per file; line & loff together for line data
 * Concantenate in time, use the dts2str mechanism extended by an agg keyword
 * q: The aggregated variable
 * 'std'?: Standard deviation of the variable during the aggregation periods
 * ('trend'+'trend_off')?: Linear trend during the aggregation periods and offsets
 * 'min'?: Minimum value during the aggregation period
 * 'max'?: Maximum value during the aggregation period
 * Problem: Potential later addition of optional data means extending existing nc file
 * Example file name: ei.ans.1979-1982.daily.pv2000.u.nc


Option 1 for eof:
 * Split file by EOF
 * Collect all relevant information about the EOF in one file
 * 'dates', 'values' for eof follow ts specification
 * 'regressed_dates', 'regressed_values' for regressed ts follow extended ts specification 
 * 'pattern' for the actual EOF spatial structure
 * q*: For variables regressed on the EOF, including their vertical level information
 * Problem: Saving results means extending existing nc file
 * Problem: How to save the same variable on different (types of) vertical level in one file?
 * Example file name: ei.ans.eof01.1979-2014.monthly.pv2000.jetaxis.nc


Option 2 for eof:
 * Split file by EOF and vertical level
   [...]


Option 3 for eof:
 * Split file by EOF, vertical level and variable
   [...]


Option 1 for composite:
 * Combine all variables into one file
 * 'dates', 'values' with binary values follow the ts specification
 * Problem: Saving results means extending existing nc file
 * Problem: How to save the same variable on different (types of) vertical level in one file?
 * q*: For composited variables, including their vertical level information
 * Example file name: ei.ans.NAO+@DJF.1979-2014.nc


Option 2 for composite:
 * Combine variables on one vertical level into one file
 * 'dates', 'values' with binary values follow the ts specification
 * Problem: Saving results means extending existing nc file
 * Problem: Still several files per composite
 * q*: For composited variables 
 * Example file name: ei.ans.NAO+@DJF.1979-2014.pv2000.nc


Option 3 for composite:
 * Follow structure for instantaneous/aggregated data: One variable per file
 * 'dates', 'values' with binary values follow the ts specification
 * Problem: Many small files, duplicating 'dates' and 'values'
 * Problem: 
 * q*: For composited variables 
 * Example file name: ei.ans.NAO+@DJF.1979-2014.pv2000.jetaxis_freq.nc


Variant for any option for composites:
 * Define lists of composites that are to be saved into one file
 * Useful for example for NAO: +/- in one file, MJO: all 8 phases in one file, composite evolution.
 * Example file name: ei.ans.MJO@DJF.1979-2014[...].nc


Current aggregated data
 * 'mean': (y,x) or (t,y,x)
 * 'stddev'?: (y,x) or (t,y,x) 
 * 'min'?: (y,x) or (t,y,x)
 * 'max'?: (y,x) or (t,y,x)
 * 'trend'?: (y,x) or (t,y,x)
 * 'icept'?: (y,x) or (t,y,x)
 * Different file naming conventions: 
   (1) agg.01.5d.pv2000.npz, (2) ei.ans.stat.pv2000.u.npy, (3) ei.ans.1979.pv2000.z.u.stat.npy


Current EOF (idx:n) related data

 * EOF timeseries: dates(t), tseries(n,t), rtseries(n,t)
 * EOF pattern: pattern(n,y,x), rpattern(n,y,x)
 * Regressed timeseries: ts(n,y,x), rts(n,y,x)
 * Regressed patterns: data(n,q,y,x), rdata(n,q,y,x)


Current composite (idx:n) data

 * Composite patterns: data(n,q,y,x)
